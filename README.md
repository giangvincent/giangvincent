I am a seasoned developer with over six years of experience in PHP and JavaScript, building dynamic, scalable, and user-centric web applications. My expertise in backend frameworks like Laravel and Symfony, developed over the past three years, has enabled me to create efficient, secure, and well-architected solutions for various industries.

In the e-commerce domain, I have two years of experience specializing in Shopware, working on both Shopware 5 and Shopware 6 platforms. I have delivered feature-rich online stores with customized plugins, seamless integrations, and tailored themes to meet specific business requirements.

My skill set combines a deep understanding of web technologies, problem-solving abilities, and a commitment to best practices. I thrive in collaborative environments and continuously seek to leverage modern tools and techniques to drive business growth through innovative digital solutions.
